            My name is Paribesh Upreti and I'm an aspiring developer. <br></br>
            I graduated from Fossil Ridge High School in 2021, and I'm currently attending UTD as a Computer Science major. <br></br>
            I'm about to graduate this upcoming semester, and I'm thrilled to be going into the workforce. <br></br>
            I'm passionate, driven, and always excited to learn new technologies. My current skills encompass react, node.js, javascript, typescript, Java, and python.
